## Slide 1 - Introduction

"Hi, everyone. My name is Ira, and today I'm going to talk about an interesting topic - audio and video APIs. These are powerful tools that allow us to create rich media experiences on the Internet."

---

## Slide 2 - Definition of API

### Subtitle of the slide: "What is an API?"

"Before diving into the details, let's quickly understand what an API is. API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is essentially a set of conventions that define how software components should interact. They provide us with rules for accessing functionality."

---

## Slide 3 - Basics of Audio and Video APIs

"When we talk about audio and video APIs in the context of web development, we usually refer to HTML5 APIs, which allow us to integrate audio and video elements into our web applications."

---

## Slide 4 - HTML Audio and Video Elements

"The `<video>` and `<audio>` elements are used to embed video and audio into web pages. Examples of such implementations include standard HTML video and audio players with native control elements."

**Subslide 4.1:** "Example of video implementation"

**Subslide 4.2:** "Example of audio implementation"

---

## Slide 5 - API Overview

"These APIs include HTMLMediaElement, Web Audio API, and MediaStream API."

---

## Slide 5.1 - HTMLMediaElement API

"The HTMLMediaElement API, part of the HTML specification, provides functions for programmatically controlling video and audio players, such as HTMLMediaElement.play(), HTMLMediaElement.pause(), and so on. This interface is available for both <audio> and <video> elements, as the functionalities you would want to implement are almost identical."

## Slide 5.2 - Web Audio API

"Next is the Web Audio API, a high-level API that allows us to process and synthesize audio in web applications. It is used for tasks such as spatial effects, audio mixing, and music composition."

## Slide 5.3 - MediaStream API

"And finally, we have the MediaStream API. It allows access to data streams, for example, from the user's camera or microphone. It forms the foundation for any video or audio processing on the Internet."

---

## Slide 6 - Practical Application

### 6.1 video API

"Let's consider a practical example of using these APIs to create a basic video player."
If you are embedding a video, you need to add a source tag inside the video tag. Here you will provide the video path or its link. The source tag will take an src attribute to define the video clip you want to embed in your website. It also takes a type attribute which defines the video format.
You can give a controls attribute to the video tag, enabling the default set of playback controls in your video.
You do not need the source tag if there is only a single source of the video you are interested in embedding. You can add the video path directly inside your video tag.

---

## Slide 7 - Audio API

"This code demonstrates the use of the Web Audio API to create and play a simple sound. 
The audio API works almost the same way as the video API. It is used to embed sound content in a document. It takes an src that is either the path to the static audio file or a link from where you want to integrate the audio. If there is more than one source, you will have to use the source tag inside the audio tag.

---

## Slide 8 - Play and Pause for Audio or Video

"Let's implement perhaps the most important control - the play/pause button."

1. Let’s take a look to the following code so that the `playPauseMedia()` function is called when the play button is clicked:

2. Now, let's define `playPauseMedia()` function
"Here, we use an `if` statement to check if the audio or video is paused. The `HTMLMediaElement.paused` property returns `true` if the media is paused, which happens at any time when the audio or video is not playing, including when it is set to a duration of 0 after its initial load. If it's paused, we set the `data-icon` attribute value on the play button to 'u', which is the 'pause' icon, and call the `HTMLMediaElement.play()` method to play the media. On the second click, the button will toggle back - showing the 'play' icon again, and the audio or video will be paused using `HTMLMediaElement.pause()`."

---

## Slide 9 - Stopping Audio or Video

### 9.1 "Next, let's take a look at the functionality to control the stop of audio or video. 
"The click event is obvious - we want to stop the audio or video by running our `stopMedia()` function when the stop button is clicked. However, we also want to stop the audio or video when it finishes playing - this is indicated by the `ended` event, so we also set up a listener to execute the function when this event is triggered."

### 9.2 "Now, let's define `stopMedia()` function”
"In the HTMLMediaElement API, there is no `stop()` method - its equivalent is `pause()` for audio or video and setting its `currentTime` property to 0. Setting `currentTime` to a value immediately moves the media to that position. After this, all that remains is to set the displayed icon to the 'play' icon. Regardless of whether the audio or video was paused or playing when the stop button was clicked, you want it to be ready for playback after this."

## Slide 10 - Audio and Video Manipulation with JavaScript

JavaScript provides developers with powerful tools for programmatically changing and manipulating audio and video elements on web pages. This opens up endless possibilities for creating unique and interactive media applications. Let's explore some interesting examples of how JavaScript allows you to control various aspects of audio and video.

*1. Volume Control:*
With JavaScript, you can easily adjust the volume level of audio and video playback. For example, by using the `volume` property of the `HTMLMediaElement` objects, you can set the volume level from 0.0 (mute) to 1.0 (full volume). This allows you to create interesting effects and mix different sound elements.

*2. Applying Sound Effects:*
Using the Web Audio API, you can create and customize various sound effects, such as reverb, delay, echo, and more. You can combine multiple audio sources and apply settings to each of them, enabling you to create unique audio players and audio visualizations.

*3. Playback Speed Adjustment:*
By using the `playbackRate` property of the `HTMLMediaElement` objects, you can control the playback speed of audio and video. Setting the value to 1.0 means normal playback speed, values less than 1.0 slow down the playback, and values greater than 1.0 speed it up. This can be useful for creating slow-motion or fast-forward effects for video or audio.

*4. Adding Text Subtitles and Captions:*
JavaScript allows you to dynamically add text subtitles or captions to video elements. You can programmatically control the display time, style, and content of subtitles, making it possible to create multilingual video content.

*5. User Interaction:*
JavaScript also enables the creation of interactive control elements for audio and video. For instance, you can add custom buttons to navigate to specific playback points, control video or audio looping, and display progress bars or timelines to track playback time.

*In Conclusion:*
JavaScript offers amazing possibilities for manipulating audio and video in web applications. Combining HTML5 audio and video APIs with the Web Audio API allows you to create engaging media projects that enrich the user experience and provide your web applications with unique functionalities.
